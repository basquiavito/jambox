How dare I say this is the best **crossover** combo ever? What about [Iverson crosses Michael Jordan ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=6000bd012a0623ace6a703dd), or [ Stephen Curry dropping Chris Paul ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=6000bd5e2a0623ace6a703de) twice. Perhaps the step back by [James Harden over Ricky Rubio](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=6000bdbf2a0623ace6a703df). We have many great options but you have to know and recognize this blueprint by *Jason Tatum*.  






On this play, rookie De’Andre Hunter was playing Tatum close on defense. Hunter is a 6’8, forward with great hands and versatility. Tatum, aware of that, drove right ( 80 ) and did a  **reverse between the legs** crossover to freeze Hunter. Then, he shakes him up with a *left hand* **in-and-out** followed by a *left hand* **crossover**. This alone would have been enough, but he was forced to use an extra countermove. 


Finally, The stage is set for Tatum. Now with Hunter lost, and without any idea of what is coming next, Tatum is ready to take a shot.  But wait, not so fast...  [*Brandon Goodwin*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodwbr01.html) comes running to double team Tatum, leaving [*Marcus Smart*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smartma01.html) open. It is awkward how he runs to double team before Tatum even set his shot as if he knew that Hunter was already doomed.  And because of  Goodwin's [*impudence*](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impudent#:~:text=An%20impudent%20person%20is%20bold,%2C%20and%20pudens%2C%20meaning%20shame.), Tatum was force to take an extra countermove, a **side-step-back**, before pulling up from 3s. 

This a very well-crafted play, with impeccable footwork. *Jason Tatum* has many nice highlights, but this one is a real outlier.
