How dare I say this is the best **crossover** combo ever? What about [Iverson crosses Michael Jordan ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29), or [ Stephen Curry dropping Chris Paul ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29) twice. Or maybe the step back by [James Harden over Ricky Rubio](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29). We have many options but you gotta get to know and recognize this blueprint by *Jason Tatum*.

On this play, rookie De’Andre Hunter was playing Tatum close on defense. Hunter is a 6’8, and  forward with great hands and versatility.  Tatum , aware of that, drove right ( 80 ), and did a **reverse between the legs** crossover to freeze Hunter. Then, he shakes him up with a *left hand* **in-and-out** followed by a *left hand* **crossover** (This alone would have been enough, but he got an extra countermove). 


Finally, The stage is set for Tatum. He got Hunter lost, not knowing what is coming next, he is just trying to stand there and pretend he is playing defense. Now, [*Brandon Goodwin*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodwbr01.html) comes running to double team Tatum, leaving [*Marcus Smart*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smartma01.html) open. Its  weird how he runs to double team before Tatum even set his shoot, as if he knew that Hunter was doomed.And so, because of Goodwin's [*impudence*](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impudent#:~:text=An%20impudent%20person%20is%20bold,%2C%20and%20pudens%2C%20meaning%20shame.), Tatum was force to take an extra countermove **side-step-back** before pulling up from 3s. 

This a very well-crafted play, with an impeccable footwork. *Jason Tatum* has many nice highlight, but this one is a real outlier.
