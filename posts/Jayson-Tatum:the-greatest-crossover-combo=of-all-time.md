How dare I say this is the best **crossover** combo ever? What about [Iverson crosses Michael Jordan ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29), or [ Stephen Curry dropping Chris Paul ](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29) twice. Or maybe the step back by [James Harden over Ricky Rubio](https://hoopscript.com/article?_id=60004502808c82e90fc94d29). We have many options but you gotta get to know and recognize this blueprint by *Jason Tatum*.

On this play, rookie De’Andre Hunter was playing Tatum close on defense. Hunter is a 6’8, and  forward with great hands and versatility.  Tatum , aware of that, drove right ( 80 ), and did a **reverse between the legs** crossover to freeze Hunter.
