Dribbling has changed drastically in last 20 years. Today players are more flashy and athletics. Nonetheless, **Fundamentals** are the same as the 80s, because they are timeless. The *Fadeaway* that [MJ pattented] is timeless. The [Allen Iverson] **Crossover** is timeless.

The **U-tep two steps** from [Tim] [timmy] is timeless. Many more movements are going to be test again in the years to come but certain movements never change.

The basic of dribbling, at it lowest level of mastery, involves only a **bounce** dribble. A bounce up and down of the ball. This is the first element of the array of foot movements.
