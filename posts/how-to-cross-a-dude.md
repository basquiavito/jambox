Manolo thinks that doing a crossover is as simple as passing the ball from one hand to the other in front of the legs. When I explained that a true crossover has more parts he grinned. Then, I tried to show him how to do it right, but he refused, saying that my way is too complex.

So, then I took him to the court and had my man Justin guard him in a one-to-one short game, so he can show what he got. He tried to cross Justin like three times, but he didn't even flinch. Manolo's crossover has no juice in it, because it is too obvious, and lacks a touch of nonchalance.

Manolo agreed to learn my way, and I was happy to share my knowledge. I showed him a video of Allen Iverson's infamous crossover vs Michael Jordan in slow motion.

## Look beyond the surface

Manolo said that Iverson didn't even cross him, because MJ almost blocked him. While that has an inch of truth, what he is missing is the fact that Iverson actually crossed him three times. The first small cross was a mere bait to see if Jordan would bite it ( and he did ). Now the second cross, was so quick, powerful, determined, that Jordan could not recover on time. Then, to finish him ( fatality ) Iverson used a super crossover in sync with a quick first step.

But, How did AI did it?

 

## Allen Iverson's Hidden Gem
Iverson had a three consecutive dribble combo that he loved to use whenever he had a decent defender on him.

The combo was:

1. bounce ( 0 )
2. crossover ( 1 )
3. between the legs (3)

He would execute these three in sync, one after the other. For us, they were three different moves, for Iverson it was only one. The name of this combo is SMOKE.

I told Manolo that the first thing he had to understand was that it is harder to crosses someone from scratch. That it is better to use some smoke, bait, or anything to distract the defender and disrupt his attention.

## A quick first Step
A fast, quick first step is a must for a crossover to be effective. If you cross someone, and your first step is slow and weak, you will not gain any separation from your defender. Even more, some defenders are fast and wary and know the right moves. To get by this kind of defenders you need a light speed first step.

## Key Points

To do a proper crossover pull-up while dribbling with the left hand: 

1. Step forward with your left foot.
2. Cross the ball to the right hand
3. Step forward with your right foot and received the ball
4. Take the first step with the left foot
5. Grab the ball and step forward with the right foot ( foot should parallel now.)
6. Shoot. 


## Hoopcode
I wanted to give Manolo a piece of code, that he can carry with him until he could memorize the move. So, here is the original code for Allen Iverson crossover over Michael Jordan: F 013 F 013 18 G$.

1. F if for step forward
2. 013 is smoke
3. 1 crossover
4. 8 first step
5. G grabs the ball
5. $ shoot

This code reads: Double Smoke Cross Pull-Up (DSCP).

## Conclusion

The crossover is a powerful move that helps player gain separation from its defender. It is better used after a decoy to add an element of surprise to the drive. Practicing the crossover pull-up is crucial for any guard to develop a good mid-range game.
