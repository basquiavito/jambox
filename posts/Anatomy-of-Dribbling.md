## Anatomy of Dribbling

Dribbling allows us to move from on place to another thorugh the use of movements, or gems. Each gem has a function, a form, a trayectory, and side effects.

We divided dribbling into  two containers:
 1. **Ballwork** for the  movements of the ball
 2. **Footwork** for the  movements of the foot. 
 
 *16* gems in total.

The components of the **Ballwork** container are:

1. bounce (0)
2. crossover(1)
7. behind the back (2)
3. between the legs(3)
4. reverse between the legs(4)
5. in and out(5)
6. shammgod (9)
7. nutmeg (N)

These components do not need any step or drive. They work fine even if your standing fixed in a same place. You do not need to move your foot to make this gems. 

Whenever a player do any ballwork while standing in a fixed point , he enters a passive state; After adding any footwork, he enters an active one. An active state is a powerful state.



The elements of the **Footwork** comparment are:

1. step back ( 6 )
2. spin ( 7 ) 
3. **first step (8)**
4. step forward (F)
5. post-up (P)
6. hesitation (H)
7. chasse (CH)
8. Stutter step (SS)


## Basketball Drills

Get familiar witht the matrix, and enter an active state.

 
>>8 + 0  known as the matrix (∞).

>>∞  + F   says that the matrix pop.

>>∞ + F + ∞ known as a stride.


 

>>0 + 9 known as Shammod
