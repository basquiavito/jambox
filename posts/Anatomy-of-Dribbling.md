## Anatomy of Dribbling

Dribbling allows us to move from on place to another thorugh the use of movements, or gems. Each gem has a function, a form, a trayectory, and side effects.


### 8 ocho or first step

####  Function :  
    1. initiator of the dribble
    2. precursor of the stride
    3. allows us to run
    4. Stem cell of the Diamonds
    5. move around in general
#### Form : 

the foot moves forward in from of the other. It is like the hypotenusa of a  triangle a 90.

#### Trayectory :
`A moves to C` |
`B moves to D`

#### Side effects:

Many.
