It’s difficult to overstate just how dominant Doncic has been thus far in his career. He was a teenage Euroleague MVP, the first of his kind. He was a Euroleague Finals MVP. He won the Spanish ACB league MVP award as a teenager, too, also the first to do that. Undeniably, Doncic was the most decorated prospect in the history of European hoops. For him to fall to No. 3 in the 2018 draft was absurd. Since then, all Doncic has done is become the best prospect in the NBA. The Slovenian would be a top five player in MVP voting for me this season. There are two reasons. First, from a production standpoint, Doncic is just ridiculous. The 28.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game he’s averaging? Only Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook have done that in a season before. And he’s doing it on a higher true-shooting percentage than either of them ever did. And for reference on the current do-everything star that exists in our basketball ecosystem? LeBron James has never averaged 9.3 rebounds, and has only averaged 8.7 assists in a season three times.

<p>When Williamson was in the draft last season, <a href="https://theathletic.com/977823/" target="_blank">I thought he was pretty clearly the best prospect</a> who had entered the process since Anthony Davis back in 2012. He was genuinely, historically productive in his lone season with the Blue Devils, averaging 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.1 steals and 1.8 blocks. Unsurprisingly, no one had done that in the last 30 years of college basketball in terms of across-the-board production. But at the end of the day, the thing that matters most is if he can play at the NBA level. And after undergoing surgery to repair a torn meniscus prior to the season opener, Williamson returned in January to prove that he’s going to be an absolute monster. His 23 points, six rebounds and two assists while shooting 58 percent from the field? It’s a small sample of 19 games, but no rookie had ever achieved those thresholds across the board. He wasn’t on pace to post the <em>best</em> rookie season ever — for me, that’s either Lew Alcindor in 1970 or Walt Bellamy in 1961 — but he was on pace to be somewhere in the top 10. And the scary thing is that he was getting even better the further away he got from injury. In his final 11 games prior to the shutdown, he averaged 26.4 points on 59.8 percent from the field.</p>

Tatum has quickly become one of the absolute best young players in the NBA. He’s a monster two-way wing who had already established himself as a future All-Star coming into the year, and then made that leap into legitimate stardom by the time the calendar rolled over to 2020. Following a three-game losing streak, the Celtics returned to Boston on Jan. 11 and needed to regroup. At that point it seems like the lightbulb turned on for Tatum and he realized that he needed to be the guy to lead the way on offense. He dropped 41 points that night in a monster 35-point victory against the Pelicans, and from there just looked like a totally different type of player. Over his final 23 games before the shutdown, Tatum averaged 27.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists. He hit 49 percent of his shots from the field, including 45.5 percent of the nearly eight 3-point attempts per game that he was taking. He became one of the absolute best offensive players in the NBA, a creative force who seemed to be morphing into the kind of guy who could carry Boston to multiple playoff series victories.

Simmons is, by far, the most interesting player in the NBA to me. From a play style perspective in how he fits with his teammates. From an on-court production perspective. From a narrative perspective, given that every game seems to be a referendum on his play and his future. Everything about Simmons fascinates me. And here’s the thing: I’m still remarkably high on Simmons. … Basically, with Simmons, you have one of the most devastating transition players in the league, one of the best defensive players in the league, and one of the best passers in the league, paired with an athletic frame that is unique from a power and quickness perspective. That’s an incredible starting point for a player who is only 23. … My bet is that Simmons figures out how to shoot at some point and becomes an effective player in the playoffs. I don’t think he’ll ever quite reach the heights Giannis and LeBron have reached, but I wouldn’t be shocked if he got into the mix in MVP voting at some point within the next few years. Despite the obvious flaws, he’s really close to being a superstar player.

<p>Simply put, Young has developed into one of the most creative offensive forces in the NBA, regardless of age. … He averaged 29.6 points and 9.3 assists on a pretty ridiculous 59.5 true-shooting percentage. The players who posted at least that many points per game total on that level of efficiency? It’s a veritable set of Hall of Famers, guys who sprinkle the NBA’s all-time elite. Try these names on for size: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, Adrian Dantley, Kevin Durant, George Gervin, James Harden, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Bob McAdoo, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kiki Vandeweghe. That’s 14 guys, 13 of whom are Hall of Famers or future Hall of Famers, plus Vandeweghe, who did it in one of the insanely uptempo Doug Moe seasons in Denver, where the Nuggets posted a pace that was absurdly nine possessions above the league average per game. And the number of players to post that scoring combination while also averaging nine assists? How about just Young this season and Harden in 2017? … To complain about what he’s accomplished at this point would be missing the forest for the trees.</p>
