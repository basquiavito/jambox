That’s an incredible starting point for a player who is only 23. … My bet is that Simmons figures out how to shoot at some point and becomes an effective player in the playoffs. I don’t think he’ll ever quite reach the heights Giannis and LeBron have reached, but I wouldn’t be shocked if he got into the mix in MVP voting at some point within the next few years. ",

    "accolades": "The Slovenian would be a top five player in MVP voting for me this season. There are two reasons. First, from a production standpoint, Doncic is just ridiculous. The 28.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game he’s averaging? Only Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook have done that in a season before. And he’s doing it on a higher true-shooting percentage than either of them ever did. And for reference on the current do-everything star that exists in our basketball ecosystem? LeBron James has never averaged 9.3 rebounds, and has only averaged 8.7 assists in a season three times.",

It’s rare for a rookie point guard to be the maestro of a playoff team, but Morant is well on his way to doing just that. On top of it, he’s one of the most exciting prospects league-wide, and it’s very easy to see how his skillset as a shooter and passer is going to grow with time. Morant is going to be an All-Star point guard for a long-time, and the Grizzlies are building really intelligently around him, with players and a scheme that make a lot of sense.",

    "accolades": "Tatum went from being an average pull-up shooter to one of the absolute best high-usage pull-up shooters in the league. This year, among the 72 players in the NBA who took at least 150 pull-up jumpers, Tatum was the fifth-best, hitting them at a 53.1 effective field goal percentage. The only players ahead of him in pull-up efficiency this year are lead guard maestros Harden, Lillard, his teammate Walker, and Chris Paul. Oh yeah, and he did it while scoring 341 points on jumpers off the bounce in halfcourt settings, 13th-best in the league and only behind Kawhi Leonard among wings. ",
